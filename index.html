                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Andrew, a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I am passionate about creating technology characterized by the intersection of
                    efficiency. aesthetics, and entertainment. With that in mind, I am currently interested in becoming a full stack engineer, although I am also open to other realms of software engineering.

                        <h5>Software Engineer</h5>
                        <p>
                            At Smount HealthTech, I worked on an android mobile health app that allows people to easily monitor the health conditions of their 
                            family members through realtime, shareable health records that can either be updated automatically or manually. Specifically, I implemented
                            an alert system, RabbitMQ messaging queues and an SQLite database which faciliated the secure transfer of messages and data through RSA encryption/decryption.

                        <h5>Academic Intern</h5>
                        <p>
                            As an Academic Intern for a data structures class, I assisted in lab sections and office hours by helping groups of 20-30 students with
                            course projects, homework, and checking off weekly lab assignments. Some of the fundamental concepts that I would help students with include k-d trees, Dijkstra's
                            algorithm, quicksort, and more.

                        <h3>Camera Slider</h3>
                        <p>
                            Created a mobile-controlled camera slider that moves based on the distance and time interval set by the user on the app. All backend requests are handled by
                            a Raspberry Pi, and a servo-motor controls the movement of the slider. The app was built using SwiftUI, and the connection between the app and the Pi was established
                            using BLE technology.

                        <h3>NetGuard</h3>
                        <p>
                            Built an IoT security system that detects DDoS attacks and protects IoT devices by shutting down all ports, notifying the user of the attack and then uploading the attack 
                            information to an Azure database. Users can then reconfigure the device through a custom SSH key generated by this system. Developed using Python, Docker, Azure, Twilio and
                            Remote.it. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Workout Generator</h3>
                        <p>
                            Developed an iOS fitness app that generates a custom workout for the user based on the muscle groups that they select. These workouts, along with physical stats like weight and 
                            height, are saved on Firebase. Firebase Authentication is also used to identify each user.
